# About Me 👨‍🏫

Hi there, I'm Pablo Azevedo Sampaio, an Associate Professor at Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil. 🇧🇷

I love studying, teaching and... coding. My favorite programming language is Python 🐍. My primary focus and interest now lie in the exciting world of **Reinforcement Learning** projects.


## Featured Projects

- 🤖 **Reinforcement Learning Made Easy in Python**: I've created a comprehensive project with step-by-step instructions, making Reinforcement Learning accessible to Portuguese-speaking enthusiasts. Dive into the world of RL with this project: [rl_facil](https://github.com/pablo-sampaio/rl_facil).

- 📦 **Arduino & PlatformIO Project:** I've created an open-source C/C++ project that you can find on GitHub. It's all about RFID with MFRC522. Check it out here: [easy_mfrc522](https://github.com/pablo-sampaio/easy_mfrc522).

- ☕ **Java Enthusiast:** In addition to Python and C/C++, I also have a strong background in Java. You can explore some of my older academic projects in Java on my GitHub profile.


## Continuous Learning

I have a deep love for learning and see myself as a lifelong student before an educator. 📚

But I also love teaching and sharing knowledge in any form! 👨‍🏫


## Personal interests

- My family
- Acoustic Guitar
- Bible
